# Rodents age prediction

The project was developed for the Institute of Maritime and Tropical Medicine in Gdynia, a research unit of the Medical University of Gda≈Ñsk. Its primary objective was to implement machine learning for age prediction of rodents, specifically voles, as a replacement for the time-consuming manual classification process. The Decision Tree Classifier was chosen as the most suitable algorithm for the project's needs due to its high accuracy and simplicity in visualization. The algorithm was trained on data from previous years, using various independent variables, and was further optimized through cost complexity pruning. The model achieved an accuracy of 90% on the test set and 88% using 5-fold cross-validation. The predicted results will be used for the institute's international research on diseases transmitted by rodents.
